                                I am interested in a lot of concepts in programming. To name a few, 
                                I love to read upon concepts in Web Development, Game Development, DevOps, 
                                and Machine Learning. I also love to learn about new technologies and how they 
                                can be used to make our lives easier. I also like watching the news and 
                                reading fantasy adventure books.

                    Now... onto the autobiography part of this website! 
                    I was born in the Philippines and moved to Canada when I was around 3 years old. 
                    Ever since I was little, I have always been interested in computers. I would always play games like Wizard101, Poptropica, and even Arthur and the Invisibles. 
                    I would also play on a Game Boy and a PSP. Ah, good times. Unfortunately, I was never able to experience any Nintendo consoles, but I did play on my friends' consoles.
                    My life wasn't just being a straight god-like gamer; I was also busy with a lot of extracurricular activities. I was always playing sports, from soccer 
                    to basketball to swimming. Not only did I play sports, but I used to play the piano. I was never really good at it, but I did enjoy it.
                </p>
                <p class="autobiography-text"> 
                    But games and sports wasn't the only thing I did. I was also academically present.
                    My grades weren't at the top of the school or anything, but I was always striving to be the best I could be. 
                    It wasn't until High school that I was able to find my passion. I took a course in grade 9 that was based on block coding and Python.
                    I wasn't necessarily sure if it was going to be my future, but it was definitely something I looked forward to. I joined a bunch of science and tech clubs
                    throughout my last three years of high school, and I was able to learn so many things.
                </p>
                <p class="autobiography-text">
                    Once grade 12 came, I originally thought computer or electrical engineering
                    was the path I wanted to take. It wasn't until I decided to take a computer science course in grade 12 that was based on Java. Once again, I felt like a little kid,
                    playing around with the code and the syntax, seeing what I was capable of. At the end of the course, we learnt how to create a game, and that really did it for me.
                    So here I am, my second year of university, studying computer science at TMU.
