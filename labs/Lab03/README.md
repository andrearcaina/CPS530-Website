# Basis of Lab03
## Part A
Create a web page using CSS media queries, viewport and fluid grids design to respond to desktop, tablet and mobile displays. Use only pure HTML and CSS.
- You must use CSS media queries and viewport to implement a fluid response for 3-5 different breakpoints: desktop, tablet and mobile. Look online for common responsive breakpoints.
- Make it about a city (my city was chosen for me)
## Part B
Recreate the exact same webpage in Part A but using the Bootstrap framework instead.
## Part C
On this web page, compare **Part A** and **Part B** in two paragraphs.  
- What were the challenges encountered?
- Which one is easier, took less time and basically which one did you like best?
- Make the page attractive and readable. Include links to the other two pages.
