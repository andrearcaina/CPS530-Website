            Part A was harder. It's definitely more time consuming as well. The problem was making it responsive. The navbar was too hard to change or think about, and literally everything else. Overall, Part A was a lot harder than Part B.

        <p class="text">
            On the other hand, Part B was literally like doing Part A but with a blueprint and more tools. I have the layout I want to achieve, and I have a tool that makes the website responsive with ease. So, Part B was definitely easier than Part A. Once I finished Part B, I went back to Part A and compared the appearance. I think Part B looks and feels better, but at the end of the day, they could both be improved upon. In terms of functionality, readability, and responsiveness, Part B is better.

        <p class="text">
            In all fairness, Part B was definitely more fun. It was also easier because of the fact that I could just look at the documents and find out all the small details Bootstrap has. It definitely makes website creation easier.
