# Basis of Lab05
- use jquery/bootstrap/html2canvas
- html and css and js allowed (wow really)
## Problem 1
---
- create a simple game based on Mr. Potato Head
  - Use only the following parts: body, eyes, nose, mouth, and hat
  - You can use buttons, drag/drop, or any other technique to build the character
  - You can use clip art from the web or draw your own
- Have a button that can save your creation into an image file (png or jpg or gif)
  - use html2canvas for this 


## Problem 2
--- 
- write a function that when you hover over the image, the size of the image becomes full screen
  - must be a slow animation
- also, put an icon in the full screen image
  - when you click on this icon you revert the image to its original size
