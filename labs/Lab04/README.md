# Basis of Lab04
- use vanilla js
## Problem 1
---
- create a form asking the user for their name, address, and phone number
- validate the form items name and phone number
  - name cannot have a number
  - phone number must follow format ex: (416) 555-5555
- write a js function that transforms the phone number into a format like:
  - 416-555-5555
- create a button that will validate the form and produce the final display

## Problem 2
--- 
- write a javascript function that counts in real time the number of characters in a `<textarea>`
- create a second function that counts only the letters (A-Z and a-z) and displays that count as well

## Problem 3
---
- create a function that creates a list of bookmarks for your favourite websites
- have the function display each bookmark URL on a separate line with an icon that indicates if the link is secure or not (https vs. http)
  - if its secure: ðŸ”’ with green
  - if its unsecure: ðŸ”“ with red or grey
  - show at least one http and one https
